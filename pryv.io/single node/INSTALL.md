# Installation guide

This guide contains instructions for a Pryv.io singlenode installation.
You should have prepared your machines with the [Deployment Design Guide](https://api.pryv.com/customer-resources/#documents) first. 

## Prerequisites Check

Please run these commands and compare the output with values below. 
You might have to use `docker-ce` and your versions can be newer: 

    $ docker -v
    Docker version 17.05.0-ce, build 89658be
    
    $ docker-compose -v
    docker-compose version 1.18.0, build 8dd22a9

If your DNS is set up correctly, the following command should yield the fully qualified domain name of the machine you intend to use as a central Pryv Register server: 

    $ dig NS ${DOMAIN}

Normally, your NS records should resolve to the names you gave to the Register server you intend to set up. Please check that your A records exist and point to the same machine. 
â€‹    
## Configuration Install

Please create a directory where all your Pryv data should live. We suggest something like `'/var/pryv'`. For the purposes of this document, we'll refer to that location as `${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}`. Then follow these steps: 

  * Copy the configuration tarball to the root of the directory. 
  * Untar the configuration in place. 

You should have the following entries now: 

  * A file called `delete-user.md`. It presents a tool which allows to delete Pryv.io users.
  * A file called `ensure-permissions`. This script ensures that the correct
    permissions are set for data and log directories.
  * The file `run-config-leader` and folder `config-leader`. This is the script and configuration files that are used to launch the configuration leader service. 
  * The file `run-config-follower` and folder `config-follower`. This is the script and configuration files that are used to launch the configuration follower service. 
  * A file called `run-pryv`. This is your startup script. 
  * A directory called `pryv`. This will contain configuration and data
    directories that will be mapped as volumes in the various docker 
    containers. 
  * The files `stop-config-leader`, `stop-config-leader` and `stop-pryv`. These scripts stop the corresponding running services.

## Completing the Configuration

### Leader-follower setup

The configuration leader service will distribute the necessary configuration files for your Pryv.io platform to the configuration follower services.

The follower is declared through the leader configuration (`${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}/config-leader/conf/config-leader.json`) within a `followers` map, for example:

```
  "adminKey": "lDng9YLK3v57A8V6awdeLuaY2eaHmB7N",
  "followers": {
    "iAgeuao4GaD68oQb3hXAxAZkQ13KWWe0": {
      "url": "http://config-follower:6000",
      "role": "singlenode"
    }
  }
```

The follower in this map is indexed by a symmetric key that you can set, and also specifies its role (singlenode) and local url.

An `adminKey` can also be configured for the leader, it will be useful for platform administrators in order to interact with the leader remotely.

In the follower configuration (`${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}/config-follower/conf/config-follower.json`), provide the corresponding symmetric key (as defined above in the leader) as well as the local leader url, as follows:

```
  "leader": {
    "url": "http://config-leader:7000",
    "auth": "iAgeuao4GaD68oQb3hXAxAZkQ13KWWe0"
  }
```

### SSL certificates

All services use Nginx to terminate inbound HTTPS connections. You should have obtained a wildcard certificate for your domain to that effect. You will need to store that certificate along with the CA chain into the appropriate locations. Please follow this [link](https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate-installation-nginx.htm) to find instructions on how to convert a certificate for nginx. 

Your certificate files must be placed in these locations: 

  - `${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}/config-leader/data/singlenode/nginx/conf/secret/${DOMAIN}-bundle.crt` 
  - `${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}/config-leader/data/singlenode/nginx/conf/secret/${DOMAIN}-key.pem`

## Launching the Installation

To launch the installation, you will first need to log in to the distribution host for the Pryv docker images. You should have received a set of credentials with the delivery of the configuration files. The following assumes that you have a user id (${USER_ID}) and a secret (${SECRET}).

To log in, type: 

    $ docker login pryvsa-docker-release.bintray.io

You will be prompted for a username and password. Please enter the credentials you were provided.

Once this completes, set the required permissions on data and log directories by running the following script:

    $ sudo ./ensure-permissions

You're now ready to launch the pryv components. First, run the configuration leader service: 

    $ sudo ./run-config-leader

Then, run the configuration follower service, which will pull the necessary configuration files
 from the leader.

  $ sudo ./run-config-follower

Now that the configuration is ready, you can launch the platform:

  $ sudo ./run-pryv

This command will download the docker images that belong to your release from the docker repository and launch the component. If all goes well, you'll see a number of running docker containers when you start `docker ps`.

### Automatic restart upon configuration update
If you wish to automatically restart pryv components when some configuration update occurs you can watch the configuration files on each machine running a service-config-follower by launching the `watch-config` script (described bellow).
However, it requires you have `fs-watch` installed.
On Ubuntu 18.04 and above you can install it with

    $ sudo apt install fswatch

On other Linux versions you'll have to compile it yourself following this documentation : https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch#installation
Here is an example on how to do that on Ubuntu 16.04 :

    VERSION=1.14.0;

    pushd /tmp;

    sudo apt-get update -y;
    sudo apt dist-upgrade;
    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential; # install gcc and other compiling tools
    url="https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch/releases/download/$VERSION/fswatch-$VERSION.tar.gz"
    echo "Downloading $url"
    curl -O -J -L $url --output fswatch-$VERSION.tar.gz;
    tar xzf fswatch-$VERSION.tar.gz;
    cd fswatch-$VERSION;
    ./configure;
    make;
    sudo make install;
    sudo ldconfig;

    popd;

When the `watch-config` script is running, any changes in a file under `${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}/pryv/*/conf/` (even a simple `touch`) will trigger the `reload-module` script who will restart all the pryv containers.
In practice these changes will occure when calling the route `https://lead.${DOMAIN}/admin/notify?auth=${ADMIN_KEY}`
The `service-config-follower` will fetch all the configuration files from `service-config-leader` and write them under the `${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}/pryv/` folder, triggering the `watch-config` script.

If you want to automatically restart pryv components upon a configuration update you can launch the `watch-config` script :

    $ sudo ./watch-config --no-hup

To stop watching :

    $ sudo ./watch-config --stop-watch

## Closing Remarks

You should now have a working docker installation. You can test this by directing a browser at [https://sw.${DOMAIN}/access/register.html](https://sw.${DOMAIN}/access/register.html) and filling in the form.
